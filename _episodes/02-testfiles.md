## Download the Analysis ROOT File

As previously mentioned the aim of this workshop is to give a background on the computing essentials you may need for your future analyses. However, it would be beneficial to learn these concepts and techniques in the context of a physics analysis.

We will be working with events from a DAOD ROOT file and the instructions to download this file can be found <strong><a href="https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/YXbCrQkwnZuc3yU">here</a></strong>.

Please place that somewhere within your working directory.

> ## Setup Checklist
> - Download and installed Docker
> - Downloaded the ATLAS AnalysisBase image
> - Downloaded the ROOT file we will be working with
>
> If this is all setup, you are free to continue
