## Additional Exercises

If you found the previous exercises and setup too easy then here is a list of other tasks to try if you get time before the computing bootcamp.

> ## Exercise 1
> 
> Put in success checks throughout the `PayLoadAnalysis.cxx` code where they are needed to avoid errors and exceptions. 
> 
> There should be an unchecked status code counter at the end of your output as a hint of where they might be. 
> 
{: .challenge}

> ## Exercise 2
> 
> Adapt the `PayLoadAnalysis.cxx` code to read in a config file which contains the path to the input file and could also contain selection and cut thresholds for later. 
> 
{: .challenge}

> ## Exercise 3
> 
> Download another file from the grid and run over that instead.
>
> Maybe even a background sample to VH(bb) 
> 
{: .challenge}
