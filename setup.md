## What you need to know

Throughout this workshop we will assuming previous knowledge in Unix, Python, C++ and compiling to a basic level. Luckily these topics are heavily documented already and there is a lot of material available so if you feel you are not very confident with any of these prerequisites please read the links below and work through the examples before you arrive.

It is not necessary for you to be an expert but it would be beneficial to have some experience and to feel comfortable working with them.

## Unix and Shells

In Unix, the shell is a program that interprets commands and acts as an intermediary between the user and the inner workings of the operating system. It can help you navigate your files and directories, create, copy and delete files and repositories. Even more powerful things are possible such as working remotely, the transfer of files and shell scripting tasks you do regularly.

Software Carpentry provides in-depth tutorials on ([Unix and the Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) and more ([advanced techniques and extras](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-extras/)).

For more information and documentation...

* ([History of Unix and the Shell](https://www.distributednetworks.com/basic-unix-shell-scripts/module2/available-unix-shells.php))

Please take some time before the workshop to read through these.

## Python

Python is a popular programming language that runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics. It is rare to not come across Python in some form when working in particle physics and data analysis.

Python can be quite powerful and can be adapted to many tasks such as web development, data science â€” including machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization, scripting, and software testing.

It is recommended that you run through the Software Carpentry ([tutorial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)) before the workshop.

## Essential C++

Throughout your studies and career in particle physics, you will find a large percentage of your code and software will be written in C++. Within ATLAS for example, the software is very C++ based and many analysis frameworks are constructed using C++ with Python used for steering.

The problem with teaching C++ is that it is such a broad programming language and topic that it becomes very difficult to adequately explain all areas in a short amount of time and without pages of documentation.

Fortunately, there is a large amount of C++ material available and hopefully you can gain some basic understanding of C++ essentials if you are not familiar already.

## The Build Process

One of the computing bootcamp days will cover build systems in detail all the way from modern compilers to GNU Make and CMake but it is worth familiarising yourself beforehand with the process of compiling and linking a program.
